        <p>
          Hello, and welcome to my portfolio. My name is Nick, and throughout these pages, you will find my resume,
          works I've done, and ways to contact me. I hope you like what you see, and I look forward to hearing from you,
          if you have a project you would like me to work on. I have extensive work history in different fields (including,
          but not limited to; customer service, food service, taking calls and redirecting them, and home healthcare), and I
          have worked with a wide variety of different people with unique backgrounds. I work well both independently and
          with a team. I love facing challenges like puzzles that I can crack and improve my way of thinking to something
          beyond what it was before. I would even go so far as to believe the purpose of life is to learn.

          I dream of being a writer, and video game developer someday, but for now, I am happy with gaining new skills from
          going new places, and continuing to meet new people. I am open-minded to both others, and problems before me.
          I am currently attending a bootcamp with Ohio State University, that will grant me a certificate in Full-Stack Web
          Programming when it is completed. This class taught me multiple tools in a short time that allow me to create complex
          web applications, and deploy them, as well as approach bugs and problems in effective and creative ways. I hope
          that you will take a look over my projects and resume, both by myself and with groups, and consider me for your next
          project.
